Home Theater IR remote control

At the time of this writing, Logitech has announced they're discontinuing their once-popular Harmony remote controls. This has made me think that perhaps I can contribute to a sustainable, open source home theater remote with similar features.

I have a page set up on https://hackaday.io/project/180595-more-better-home-theater-remote to track the build.
